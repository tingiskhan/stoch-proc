# stoch-proc

`stoch-proc` is a library aiming for easily defining and inferring structural time series models in 
[pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [pyro](http://pyro.ai/). `stoch-proc` was previously integrated in 
[pyfilter](https://github.com/tingiskhan/pyfilter) but was moved into a separate library in order to enable integration
with `pyro`s inference algorithms.

## Installing

`stoch-proc` is currently not available on PyPi, so you'll have to install it via
```cmd
pip install git+https://github.com/tingiskhan/stoch-proc
```

## Examples

You'll find all the examples [here](./examples).
